# Transmission_drive_mechanism_for_FWMAV

For the piezoelectric-driven Flapping Wing Micro Aerial vehicle (FWMAV), the optimal design and theoretical calculation of the planar flexible four-link transmission mechanism were carried out. The gear ratio and the optimal linearity and approximate linearity calculation codes were written respectively, and the relevant curves were drawn.

针对压电驱动扑翼微飞行器，开展了平面柔性四连杆传动机构的优化设计和理论计算，分别编写了传动比和最优的线性度和近似线性度的计算代码，并绘制了相关的曲线。

Here, the code is written for the following topics:

1) The relationship between the transmission ratio of the transmission and the input displacement of the drive mechanism
传动机构的传动比与驱动器的输入位移之间的关系

2) Optimal linearity and approximate linearity
最优的线性度和近似线性度

3)The sensitivity analysis of the transmission ratio for the driver mechanism.
