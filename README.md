# Transmission_drive_mechanism_for_FWMAV

For the piezoelectric-driven Flapping Wing Micro Aerial vehicle (FWMAV), the optimal design and theoretical calculation of the planar flexible four-link transmission mechanism were carried out. The gear ratio and the optimal linearity and approximate linearity calculation codes were written respectively, and the relevant curves were drawn.
针对压电驱动扑翼微飞行器，开展了平面柔性四连杆传动机构的优化设计和理论计算，分别编写了传动比和最优的线性度和近似线性度的计算代码，并绘制了相关的曲线。

**Here, the code is written for the following topics:**

**1) The relationship between the transmission ratio of the transmission and the input displacement of the drive mechanism**
